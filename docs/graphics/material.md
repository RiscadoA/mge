# Material

Materials are used to specify the visual properties of a renderable object.

Each material stores a reference to a shader and its parameters.

Materials are stored on the graphics manager, and they can be either loaded from the resources manager or generated on runtime.

Every renderable stores a reference to one or more materials.
