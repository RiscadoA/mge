# Magma Game Engine

Tiny game engine I'm developing on my free time.

This engine is built on top of [MGL](https://github.com/RiscadoA/mgl).

## Goals

- Support both VR and desktop.
- Multiple rendering backends (OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, etc).
- Networking system.
- Resource management system.

You can see the goals in more detail [here](docs/goals.md).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the engine up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

This engine is built and installed with CMake.

## Documentation

You can see the documentation [here](docs/).
